<?line 69?>

<t>The Authorization API enables Policy Decision Points (PDPs) and Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) to communicate authorization requests and decisions to each other without requiring knowledge of each other's inner workings. The Authorization API is served by the PDP and is called by the PEP. The Authorization API includes an Evaluation endpoint, which provides specific access decisions. Other endpoints may be added in the future for other scenarios, including searching for subjects or resources.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>Computational services often implement access control within their components by separating Policy Decision Points (PDPs) from Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). PDPs and PEPs are defined in XACML (<xref target="XACML"/>) and NIST's ABAC SP 800-162. Communication between PDPs and PEPs follows similar patterns across different software and services that require or provide authorization information. The Authorization API described in this document enables different providers to offer PDP and PEP capabilities without having to bind themselves to one particular implementation of a PDP or PEP.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="model"><name>Model</name>
<t>The Authorization API is a transport-agnostic API published by the PDP, to which the PEP acts as a client. Possible bindings of this specification, such as HTTPS or gRPC, are described in Transport (<xref target="transport"/>).</t>

<t>Authorization for the Authorization API itself is out of scope for this document, since authorization for APIs is well-documented elsewhere. For example, the Authorization API's HTTPS binding MAY support authorization using an <spanx style="verb">Authorization</spanx> header, using a <spanx style="verb">basic</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">bearer</spanx> token. Support for OAuth 2.0 (<xref target="RFC6749"/>) is RECOMMENDED.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="features"><name>Features</name>
<t>The core feature of the Authorization API is the Access Evaluation API, which enables a PEP to find out if a specific request can be permitted to access a specific resource. The following are non-normative examples:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Can Alice view document #123?</t>
  <t>Can Alice view document #123 at 16:30 on Tuesday, June 11, 2024?</t>
  <t>Can a manager print?</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="api-version"><name>API Version</name>
<t>This document describes the API version 1.0. Any updates to this API through subsequent revisions of this document or other documents MAY augment this API, but MUST NOT modify the API described here. Augmentation MAY include additional API methods or additional parameters to existing API methods, additional authorization mechanisms, or additional optional headers in API requests. All API methods for version 1.0 MUST be immediately preceded by the relative URL path <spanx style="verb">/v1/</spanx>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="information-model"><name>Information Model</name>
<t>The information model for requests and responses include the following entities: Subject, Action, Resource, Context, and Decision. These are all defined below.</t>

<section anchor="subject"><name>Subject</name>
<t>A Subject is the user or robotic principal about whom the Authorization API is being invoked. The Subject may be requesting access at the time the Authorization API is invoked.</t>

<t>A Subject is a JSON (<xref target="RFC8259"/>) object that contains two REQUIRED keys, <spanx style="verb">type</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">id</spanx>, which have a value typed <spanx style="verb">string</spanx>, and an OPTIONAL key, <spanx style="verb">properties</spanx>, with a value of a JSON object.</t>

<dl>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">type</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>REQUIRED. A <spanx style="verb">string</spanx> value that specifies the type of the Subject.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">id</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>REQUIRED. A <spanx style="verb">string</spanx> value containing the unique identifier of the Subject, scoped to the <spanx style="verb">type</spanx>.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">properties</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>OPTIONAL. A JSON object containing any number of key-value pairs, which can be used to express additional properties of a Subject.</t>
  </dd>
</dl>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a Subject:</t>

<figure title="Example Subject" anchor="subject-example"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "alice@acmecorp.com"
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<section anchor="subject-properties"><name>Subject Properties</name>
<t>Many authorization systems are stateless, and expect the client (PEP) to pass in any properties or attributes that are expected to be used in the evaluation of the authorization policy. To satisfy this requirement, Subjects MAY include zero or more additional attributes as key-value pairs, under the <spanx style="verb">properties</spanx> object.</t>

<t>An attribute can be single-valued or multi-valued. It can be a primitive type (string, boolean, number) or a complex type such as a JSON object or JSON array.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a Subject which adds a string-valued <spanx style="verb">department</spanx> property:</t>

<figure title="Example Subject with Additional Property" anchor="subject-department-example"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "alice@acmecorp.com",
  "properties": {
    "department": "Sales"
  }
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t>To increase interoperability, a few common properties are specified below:</t>

<section anchor="subject-ip-address"><name>IP Address</name>
<t>The IP Address of the Subject, identified by an <spanx style="verb">ip_address</spanx> field, whose value is a textual representation of an IP Address, as defined in <spanx style="verb">Textual Conventions for Internet Network Addresses</spanx> <xref target="RFC4001"/>.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a subject which adds the <spanx style="verb">ip_address</spanx> property:</t>

<figure title="Example Subject with IP Address" anchor="subject-ip-address-example"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[

  }
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

</section>
<section anchor="subject-device-id"><name>Device ID</name>
<t>The Device Identifier of the Subject, identified by a <spanx style="verb">device_id</spanx> field, whose value is a string representation of the device identifier.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a subject which adds the <spanx style="verb">device_id</spanx> property:</t>

<section anchor="resource"><name>Resource</name>
<t>A Resource is the target of an access request. It is a JSON (<xref target="RFC8259"/>) object that is constructed similar to a Subject entity. It has the follow keys:</t>

<dl>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">type</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>

<section anchor="action"><name>Action</name>
<t>An Action is the type of access that the requester intends to perform.</t>

<t>Action is a JSON (<xref target="RFC8259"/>) object that contains a REQUIRED <spanx style="verb">name</spanx> key with a <spanx style="verb">string</spanx> value, and an OPTIONAL <spanx style="verb">properties</spanx> key with a JSON object value.</t>

<section anchor="access-evaluations-api"><name>Access Evaluations API</name>

<t>The Access Evaluations API defines the message exchange pattern between a client (PEP) and an authorization service (PDP) for evaluating multiple access evaluations within the scope of a single message exchange (also known as "boxcarring" requests).</t>

<section anchor="access-evaluations-request"><name>The Access Evaluations API Request</name>

<t>The Access Evaluation API Request builds on the information model presented in <xref target="information-model"/> and the 4-tuple defined in the Access Evaluation Request (<xref target="access-evaluation-request"/>).</t>

<t>To send multiple access evaluation requests in a single message, the caller MAY add an <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> key to the request. The <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> key is an array which contains a list of JSON objects, each typed as a 4-tuple, and specifying a discrete request.</t>

<t>If an <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array is NOT present, the Access Evaluations Request behaves in a backwards-compatible manner with the (single) Access Evaluation API Request (<xref target="access-evaluation-request"/>).</t>

<t>If an <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array IS present and contains one or more objects, these form distinct requests that the PDP will evaluate. These requests are independent from each other, and may be executed sequentially or in parallel, left to the discretion of each implementation.</t>

<t>If the <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array IS present and contains one or more objects, the top-level <spanx style="verb">subject</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">action</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">resource</spanx>, and <spanx style="verb">context</spanx> keys (4-tuple) in the request object MAY be omitted. However, if one or more of these values is present, they provide default values for their respective fields in the evaluation requests. This behavior is described in <xref target="default-values"/>.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example for specifying three requests, with no default values:</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "subject": {

    }
  ]
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<section anchor="default-values"><name>Default values</name>

<t>While the example above provides the most flexibility in specifying distinct values in each request for every evaluation, it is common for boxcarred requests to share one or more values of the 4-tuple. For example, evaluations MAY all refer to a single subject, and/or have the same contextual (environmental) attributes.</t>

<t>Default values offer a more compact syntax that avoids over-duplication of request data.</t>

<t>If any of the top-level <spanx style="verb">subject</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">action</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">resource</spanx>, and <spanx style="verb">context</spanx> keys are provided, they are treated as default values for the 4-tuples specified in the <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> object. Any values specified in the 4-tuples present in the <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> object take precedence over these default values.</t>

<section anchor="evaluations-options"><name>Evaluations options</name>

<t>The <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> request payload includes an OPTIONAL <spanx style="verb">options</spanx> key, with a JSON value containing a set of key-value pairs.</t>

<t>This provides a general-purpose mechanism for providing caller-supplied metadata on how the request is to be executed.</t>

<t>One such option conrtols <em>evaluation semantics</em>, and is described in <xref target="evaluations-semantics"/>.</t>

<t>A non-normative example of the <spanx style="verb">options</spanx> field is shown below:</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "evaluations": [...],
  "options": {
    "evaluation_semantics": "execute_all",
    "another_option": "value"
  }
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<section anchor="evaluations-semantics"><name>Evaluations semantics</name>

<t>By default, every request in the <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array is executed and a response returned in the same array order. This is the most common use-case for boxcarring multiple evaluation requests in a single payload.</t>

<t>With that said, three evaluation semantics are supported:</t>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t><em>Execute all of the requests (potentially in parallel), return all of the results.</em> Any failure can be denoted by <spanx style="verb">decision: false</spanx> and MAY provide a reason code in the context.</t>
  <t><em>Deny on first denial (or failure).</em> This semantic could be desired if a PEP wants to issue a few requests in a particular order, with any denial (error, or <spanx style="verb">decision: false</spanx>) "short-circuiting" the evaluations call and returning on the first denial. This essentially works like the <spanx style="verb">&amp;&amp;</spanx> operator in programming languages.</t>
  <t><em>Permit on first permit.</em> This is the converse "short-circuiting" semantic, working like the <spanx style="verb">||</spanx> operator in programming languages.</t>
</list></t>

<t>To select the desired evaluations semantic, a caller can pass in <spanx style="verb">options.evaluations_semantic</spanx> with exactly one of the following values:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">execute_all</spanx></t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">deny_on_first_deny</spanx></t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">permit_on_first_permit</spanx></t>
</list></t>

<t><spanx style="verb">execute_all</spanx> is the default semantic, so an <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> request without the <spanx style="verb">options.evaluations_semantic</spanx> flag will execute using this semantic.</t>

<t>Like the request format, the Access Evaluations Response format for an Access Evaluations Request adds an <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array that lists the decisions in the same order they were provided in the <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array in the request. Each value of the evaluations array is typed as an Access Evaluation Response (<xref target="access-evaluation-response"/>).</t>

<t>In case the <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array is present, it is RECOMMENDED that the <spanx style="verb">decision</spanx> key of the response will be omitted. If present, it can be ignored by the caller.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a Access Evaluations Response to an Access Evaluations Request containing three evaluation objects:</t>

<section anchor="errors"><name>Errors</name>

<t>There are two types of errors, and they are handled differently:
1. Transport-level errors, or errors that pertain to the entire payload.
2. Errors in individual evaluations.</t>

<t>The first type of error is handled at the transport level. For example, for the HTTP binding, the 4XX and 5XX codes indicate a general error that pertains to the entire payload, as described in Transport (<xref target="transport"/>).</t>

<t>The second type of error is handled at the payload level. Decisions default to <em>closed</em> (i.e. <spanx style="verb">false</spanx>), but the <spanx style="verb">context</spanx> field can include errors that are specific to that request.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a response to an Access Evaluations Request containing three evaluation objects, two of them demonstrating how errors can be returned for two of the evaluation requests:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>a <spanx style="verb">401</spanx> HTTPS status code indicates that the caller (policy enforcement point) did not properly authenticate to the PDP - for example, by omitting a required <spanx style="verb">Authorization</spanx> header, or using an invalid access token.</t>
  <t>the PDP indicates to the caller that the authorization request is denied by sending a response with a <spanx style="verb">200</spanx> HTTPS status code, along with a payload of <spanx style="verb">{ "decision": false }</spanx>.</t>

The following non-normative example describes this header:</t>

<t>A PDP responding to an Authorization API request that contains an <spanx style="verb">X-Request-ID</spanx> header MUST include a request identifier in the response.

</section>
<section anchor="Security"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<section anchor="communication-integrity-and-confidentiality"><name>Communication Integrity and Confidentiality</name>

<t>In the ABAC architecture, the PEP-PDP connection is the most sensitive one and needs to be secured to guarantee:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Integrity</t>
  <t>Confidentiality</t>
</list></t>

<t>As a result, the connection between the PEP and the PDP MUST be secured using the most adequate means given the choice of transport (e.g. TLS for HTTP REST).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="policy-confidentiality-and-sender-authentication"><name>Policy Confidentiality and Sender Authentication</name>

<t>Additionally, the PDP SHOULD authenticate the calling PEP. There are several ways authentication can be established. These ways are out of scope of this specification. They MAY include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Mutual TLS</t>
  <t>OAuth-based authentication</t>
  <t>API key</t>
</list></t>

<t>The choice and strength of either mechanism is not in scope.</t>

<t>Authenticating the PEP allows the PDP to avoid common attacks (such as DoS - see below) and/or reveal its internal policies. A malicious actor could craft a large number of requests to try and understand what policies the PDP is configured with. Requesting a client (PEP) be authenticated mitigates that risk.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trust"><name>Trust</name>

<t>In ABAC, there is occasionally conversations around the trust between PEP and PDP: how can the PDP trust the PEP to send the right values in? This is a misplaced concern. The PDP must trust the PEP as ultimately, the PEP is the one responsible for enforcing the decision the PDP produces.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="availability-denial-of-service"><name>Availability &amp; Denial of Service</name>

<t>The PDP SHOULD apply reasonable protections to avoid common attacks tied to request payload size, the number of requests, invalid JSON, nested JSON attacks, or memory consumption. Rate limiting is one such way to address such issues.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>00 - Initial version.</t>
  <t>01 - Refactored the optional fields of Subject, Action, and Resource into a <spanx style="verb">properties</spanx> sub-object, making it easier to design meaningful JSON-schema and protobuf contracts for the API. Also changed the <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> field from an object to an array, to preserve ordering semantics.</t>
  <t>02 - Added the evaluations API.</t>
