<abstract>
<t>This specification defines a payload schema that can be used to describe a wide variety of identity assurance metadata about a number of claims that have been assessed as meeting a given assurance level.</t>
<t>It is intended that this payload schema is re-usable across many different contexts and application layer protocols including but not limited to <xref target="OpenID"></xref> and <xref target="W3C_VCDM"></xref>.</t>
<t>This document defines a new claim relating to the identity assurance of a natural person called &quot;verified_claims&quot;.  This was originally developed within earlier drafts of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance. The work and the preceding drafts are the work of the eKYC and Identity Assurance working group of the OpenID Foundation.</t>
</abstract>

<note><name>Foreword</name>
<t>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) promotes, protects and nurtures the OpenID community and technologies. As a non-profit international standardizing body, it is comprised by over 160 participating entities (workgroup participant). The work of preparing implementer drafts and final international standards is carried out through OIDF workgroups in accordance with the OpenID Process. Participants interested in a subject for which a workgroup has been established have the right to be represented in that workgroup. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with OIDF, also take part in the work. OIDF collaborates closely with other standardizing bodies in the related fields.</t>
<t>Final drafts adopted by the Workgroup through consensus are circulated publicly for the public review for 60 days and for the OIDF members for voting. Publication as an OIDF Standard requires approval by at least 50% of the members casting a vote. There is a possibility that some of the elements of this document may be subject to patent rights. OIDF shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.</t>
</note>

<note><name>Introduction</name>
<t>This specification defines a schema for describing assured identity claims and a range of associated identity assurance metadata. Much of this definition will be optional as it depends on which processes were run, and the operational requirements for data-minimization, which elements of the JSON schema described in this document will be needed for a specific transaction.</t>
</note>

<section anchor="scope"><name>Scope</name>
<t>This specification defines the schema of JSON objects used to describe identity assurance relating to a natural person.  It consists of the definition of a new claim called <tt>verified_claims</tt> that will be registered with the IANA &quot;JSON Web Token Claims Registry&quot; established by <xref target="RFC7519"></xref>.  As part of the definition of the <tt>verified_claims</tt> claim there is also be an element defined called <tt>verification</tt> that provides a flexible container for identity assurance metadata. It is anticipated that the <tt>verification</tt> element may be used by other spec authors and implementers where the verification metadata is needed independently of the end-user verified claims.</t>

<t>[SOURCE: <xref target="OpenID"></xref>, 1.2]</t>
</section>

<section anchor="claim-provider"><name>claim provider</name>
<t>server that can return claims and verified claims about an entity</t>
<t>Note 1 to entry : A claim provider could be an OpenID Connect provider, a verifiable claim issuer or other application component that provides verified claims.</t>
<t>[SOURCE: <xref target="OpenID"></xref>, 1.2, modified - added requirement to return verified claims]</t>
</section>

<section anchor="claim-recipient"><name>claim recipient</name>

<section anchor="identity-proofing"><name>identity proofing</name>
<t>process in which an end-user provides evidence to a provider reliably identifying themselves, thereby allowing the provider to assert that identification at a useful assurance level.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="identity-verification"><name>identity verification</name>
<t>process conducted by the provider to verify the end-user's identity.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="identity-assurance"><name>identity assurance</name>
<t>process in which the provider asserts identity data of a certain end-user with a certain assurance towards another consuming entity (such as a relying party or verifier as described in <xref target="W3C_VCDM"></xref>), typically expressed by way of an assurance level</t>
<t>Note 1 to entry: Depending on legal requirements, the provider can be required to provide evidence of the identity verification process to the consuming entity.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="verified-claims"><name>verified claims</name>
<t>claims about an end-user, typically a natural person, whose binding to a particular end-user account was verified in the course of an identity verification process.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="requirements"><name>Requirements</name>
<t>The specified JSON structures defined in this document should be usable by any protocol that needs to pass assured digital identity attributes or needs to transfer identity assurance metadata between systems using the <xref target="JSON"></xref> Data Interchange Format.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="verified_claims"><name>Verified claims</name>

<section anchor="general"><name>General</name>
<t>This specification defines a generic mechanism to add verified claims to JSON-based assertions. It uses a container element, called <tt>verified_claims</tt>, to provide the claim recipient with a set of claims along with the respective metadata and verification evidence related to the verification of these claims. This way, claim recipients cannot mix up verified claims and unverified claims and accidentally process unverified claims as verified claims.</t>
<t>The following example would assert to the claim recipient that the claim provider has verified the claims provided (<tt>given_name</tt> and <tt>family_name</tt>) according to an example trust framework <tt>trust_framework_example</tt>:</t>

<sourcecode type="json">{
  &quot;verified_claims&quot;: {
    &quot;verification&quot;: {
      &quot;trust_framework&quot;: &quot;trust_framework_example&quot;
    },
    &quot;claims&quot;: {
      &quot;given_name&quot;: &quot;Max&quot;,
      &quot;family_name&quot;: &quot;Meier&quot;
    }
  }
}
</sourcecode>
<t>The normative definition is given in the following.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="base-elements"><name>Base elements</name>
<t><tt>verified_claims</tt>: A single object or an array of objects, each object comprising the following sub-elements:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>claims</tt>: Required. Object that is the container for the verified claims about the end-user.</li>
<li><tt>verification</tt>: Required. Object that contains data about the verification process.</li>
</ul>
<t>Note: Implementations shall ignore any sub-element not defined in this specification or extensions of this specification. Extensions to this specification that specify additional sub-elements under the <tt>verified_claims</tt> element may be created by the OpenID Foundation, ecosystem or scheme operators or indeed singular implementers using this specification.</t>
<t>A machine-readable syntax definition of <tt>verified_claims</tt> is given as JSON schema in <xref target="verified_claims.json"></xref>, it can be used to automatically validate JSON documents containing a <tt>verified_claims</tt> element. The provided JSON schema files are a non-normative implementation of this specification and any discrepancies that exist are either implementation bugs or interpretations.</t>
<t>Extensions of this specification, including trust framework definitions, can define further constraints on the data structure.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="claimselement"><name>Claims element</name>
<t>The <tt>claims</tt> element contains the claims about the end-user which were verified by the process and according to the policies determined by the corresponding <tt>verification</tt> element described in the next section.</t>
<t>The <tt>claims</tt> element may contain any of the following claims as defined in section 5.1 of the OpenID Connect specification <xref target="OpenID"></xref></t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>name</tt></li>
<li><tt>given_name</tt></li>
<li><tt>middle_name</tt></li>
<li><tt>family_name</tt></li>
<li><tt>birthdate</tt></li>
<li><tt>address</tt></li>
</ul>
<t>and the claims defined in <xref target="OpenID4IDAClaims"></xref>.</t>
<t>The <tt>claims</tt> element may also contain other claims provided the value of the respective claim was verified in the verification process represented by the sibling <tt>verification</tt> element.</t>
<t>Claim names may be annotated with language tags as specified in section 5.2 of the OpenID Connect specification <xref target="OpenID"></xref>.</t>
<t>The <tt>claims</tt> element may be empty, to support use cases where verification is required but no claims data needs to be shared.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="verification"><name>Verification element</name>

<section anchor="general-1"><name>General</name>
<t>This element contains the information about the process conducted to verify a person's identity and bind the respective person data to a user account.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="element-structure"><name>Element structure</name>
<t>The <tt>verification</tt> element can be used independently of OpenID Connect and OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance where there is a need for representation of identity assurance metadata in a different application protocol or digital identity data format such as <xref target="W3C_VCDM"></xref>.</t>
<t>The <tt>verification</tt> element consists of the following elements:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>trust_framework</tt>: Required. String determining the trust framework governing the identity verification process of the claim provider.
An example value is <tt>eidas</tt>, which denotes a notified eID system under eIDAS <xref target="eIDAS"></xref>.</li>
</ul>
<t>Claim recipients should ignore <tt>verified_claims</tt> claims containing a trust framework identifier they do not understand.</t>
<t>The <tt>trust_framework</tt> value determines what further data is provided to the claim recipient in the <tt>verification</tt> element. A notified eID system under eIDAS, for example, would not need to provide any further data whereas a claim provider not governed by eIDAS would need to provide verification evidence in order to allow the claim recipient to fulfill its legal obligations. An example of the latter is a claim provider acting under the German anti-money laundering law (<tt>de_aml</tt>).</t>

<ul>
<li><t><tt>assurance_level</tt>: Optional. String determining the assurance level associated with the end-user claims in the respective <tt>verified_claims</tt>. The value range depends on the respective <tt>trust_framework</tt> value. For example, the trust framework <tt>eidas</tt> can have the identity assurance levels <tt>low</tt>, <tt>substantial</tt> and <tt>high</tt>. For information on predefined trust framework and assurance level values see <xref target="predefined_values_page"></xref>.</t>
</li>
<li><t><tt>assurance_process</tt>: Optional. JSON object representing the assurance process that was followed. This reflects how the evidence meets the requirements of the <tt>trust_framework</tt> and <tt>assurance_level</tt>. The factual record of the evidence and the procedures followed are recorded in the <tt>evidence</tt> element; this element is used to cross reference the <tt>evidence</tt> to the <tt>assurance_process</tt> followed. This has one or more of the following sub-elements:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>policy</tt>: Optional. String representing the standard or policy that was followed.</li>
<li><tt>procedure</tt>: Optional. String representing a specific procedure from the <tt>policy</tt> that was followed.</li>
<li><t><tt>assurance_details</tt>: Optional. JSON array denoting the details about how the evidence complies with the <tt>policy</tt>. When present this array shall have at least one member. Each member can have the following sub-elements:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>assurance_type</tt>: Optional. String denoting which part of the <tt>assurance_process</tt> the evidence fulfills.</li>
<li><tt>assurance_classification</tt>: Optional. String reflecting how the <tt>evidence</tt> has been classified or measured as required by the <tt>trust_framework</tt>.</li>
<li><t><tt>evidence_ref</tt>: Optional. JSON array of the evidence being referred to. When present this array shall have at least one member.</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>check_id</tt>: Required. Identifier referring to the <tt>check_id</tt> key used in the <tt>check_details</tt> element of members of the <tt>evidence</tt> array. The claim provider shall ensure that <tt>check_id</tt> is present in the <tt>check_details</tt> when <tt>evidence_ref</tt> element is used.</li>
<li><tt>evidence_metadata</tt>: Optional. Object indicating any metadata about the <tt>evidence</tt> that is required by the <tt>assurance_process</tt> in order to demonstrate compliance with the <tt>trust_framework</tt>. It has the following sub-elements:</li>
<li><tt>evidence_classification</tt>: Optional. String indicating how the process demonstrated by the <tt>check_details</tt> for the <tt>evidence</tt> is classified by the <tt>assurance_process</tt> in order to demonstrate compliance with the <tt>trust_framework</tt>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><t><tt>time</tt>: Optional. Time stamp in ISO 8601 <xref target="ISO8601"></xref> <tt>YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm[:ss]TZD</tt> format representing the date and time when the identity verification process took place. This time might deviate from (a potentially also present) <tt>document/time</tt> element since the latter represents the time when a certain evidence was checked whereas this element represents the time when the process was completed. Moreover, the overall verification process and evidence verification can be conducted by different parties (see <tt>document/verifier</tt>). Presence of this element might be required for certain trust frameworks.</t>
</li>
<li><t><tt>verification_process</tt>: Optional. Unique reference to the identity verification process as performed by the claim provider. Used for identifying and retrieving details in case of disputes or audits. Presence of this element might be required for certain trust frameworks.</t>
</li>
<li><t><tt>evidence</tt>: Optional. JSON array containing information about the evidence the claim provider used to verify the end-user's identity as separate JSON objects. Every object contains the property <tt>type</tt> which determines the type of the evidence. The claim recipient uses this information to process the <tt>evidence</tt> property appropriately.</t>
</li>
</ul>
<t>Important: Implementations shall ignore any sub-element not defined in this specification or extensions of this specification.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="minimum-conformant"><name>Minimum conformant</name>
<t>Based on the definition above and that there are a significant number of optional sub-elements it is informative to show a minimum conformant <tt>verified_claims</tt> payload.
